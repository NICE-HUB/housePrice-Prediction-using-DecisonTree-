House Price Prediction using Decision Trees üè†üå≥
Introduction üìñ
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting house prices using decision tree algorithms. It's designed as a beginner-friendly introduction to machine learning concepts and implementation.

Project Overview üß†
The project uses the DecisionTreeRegressor from scikit-learn to build a predictive model based on a dataset of housing features. The goal is to demonstrate how decision trees can be applied to predict continuous variables like house prices.

Dataset üìä
The dataset used in this project includes various features such as number of bedrooms, square footage, and location, gathered from real estate listings.
